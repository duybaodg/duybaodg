## 👨‍💻 Personal Statement

Junior software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development and a keen interest in building reliable, real-world software solutions. I have hands-on experience developing backend APIs, working with frontend web technologies, and integrating systems end-to-end.

I am actively developing my skills in C# and .NET, and I am comfortable learning new stacks quickly, having worked across multiple frameworks and technologies during my studies, internship, and personal projects. I enjoy working collaboratively, learning from experienced developers, and continuously improving my technical and communication skills.
